What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
whenever I intialise a repository, I create a new git diretory. Without initialising a repository,the directory will be like a normal directory.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging is different from the former because it doesnt store files permanently. It enables one to have a logical

change per commit
